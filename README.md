**Introduction**

Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing unauthorized or fraudulent transactions made using credit cards, typically employing algorithms and machine learning models to analyze patterns and anomalies in transaction data

**Objectives of the Project**
**• Develop a Robust Fraud Detection System**: The primary objective is to design and 
implement a fraud detection system that can accurately differentiate between 
legitimate and fraudulent transactions in real-time.

**• Enhance Detection Accuracy:** By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, 
the project aims to improve the accuracy of fraud detection algorithms to minimize 
financial losses for stakeholders and enhance overall transaction security.

**• Implement Real-time Monitoring:** Implementing real-time monitoring capabilities 
will enable the timely identification of suspicious activities, allowing financial 
institutions and merchants to take immediate action to mitigate potential risks.

**• Evaluate Machine Learning Algorithms:** The project will explore the effectiveness of 
various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, naive Bayes, 
ensemble methods like AdaBoost and XGBoost, and deep learning techniques such 
as artificial neural networks, in detecting fraudulent transactions. By comparing the 
performance of these algorithms, the project aims to identify the most effective 
approaches for fraud detection
